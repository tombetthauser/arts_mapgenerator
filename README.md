# Project Details
![python logo](https://docs.humio.com/integrations/python.svg)  

This project was built with **Python** using the **pandas**, **geopandas**, **folium**, **geopy** and **os** libraries to interface with the csv data, connect with the open source map reources underpinning the maps functionality and construct the automated **HTML** **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that constitutes the final product index.html file. The installer file was written specifically for this project in **bash** shell script.

This was originally developed as two day project by [Tom Betthauser](http://www.tombetthauser.com/) in 2020.
